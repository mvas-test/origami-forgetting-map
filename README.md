# Origami Coding Test

The objective of this task is design, implement and test a thread-safe 'forgetting map'.  
A 'forgetting' map should hold associations between a ‘key’ and some ‘content’. It should implement at least two methods:  
	1. add (add an association)  
	2. find (find content using the specified key).  
	
It should hold as many associations as it can, but no more than x associations at any time, with x being a parameter passed to the constructor. The association that is least used is removed from the map when a new entry requires a space and the map is at capacity, where “least used” relates to the number of times each association has been retrieved by the “find” method.  A suitable tie breaker should be used in the case where there are multiple least-used entries. 

## Implementation

Java would be preferable.  
You may use standard collections (HashMap, LinkedList, etc.) to build your solution but the use of a pre-existing library solution with the required behaviour, though an option in everyday work, is not what we’re looking for here. 

### Executing program

Initialise the Forgetting Map class using a number for the max allowed associations:
```java
ForgettingMap<String, String> FORGETTING_MAP new ForgettingMap<>(5);
```
and then use as any other Map.
